  ## OpenShift Monitoring
In this lab you will explore various aspects of the builtin OpenShift
Monitoring. This includes an overview of the OpenShift Alertmanager UI,
accessing the Prometheus web console, running PromQL (Prometheuses Query
Language) queries to inspect the cluster and finally looking at Grafana
dashboards.

### OpenShift Monitoring

OpenShift Container Platform includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and
self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the Prometheus open source
project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster
components and includes a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster
administrator about any occurring problems and a set of Grafana dashboards.
The cluster monitoring stack is only supported for monitoring OpenShift
Container Platform clusters.

#### Connect to the OpenShift Monitoring Alertmanager UI

1. Login to the link:{{ MASTER_URL }}[OpenShift Web Console] with the kubeadmin credentials.

[WARNING]
====
You will receive a self-signed certificate error in your browser when you
first visit the OpenShift Web console. When OpenShift is installed, by default, a CA
and SSL certificates are generated for all inter-component communication
within OpenShift, including the web console.
====
+
1. On the left hand side, click on the "Monitoring" drop down.
1. Click on "Alerts". This page is the "Alertmanager UI".


##### Contents of Alertmanager UI

The main page of the Alertmanager UI is the Alerts page.

1. Filtering alerts by their names.
1. Filtering the alerts by their states. To fire, some alerts need a certain
  condition to be true for the duration of a timeout. If a condition of an
  alert is currently true, but the timeout has not been reached, such an alert
  is in the Pending state.
1. Alert name.
1. Description of an alert.
1. Current state of the alert and when the alert went into this state.
1. Value of the Severity label of the alert.
1. Actions you can do with the alert.

##### Metrics UI (Prometheus Console)
In addition to the Alertmanager UI, OpenShift monitoring provides the
"Mertics" UI (aka the "Prometheus Console") which allows for real time
queries of current metrics. This is useful when inspecting an alert as it
allows queries for the alert's metric values over time.

1. On the left hand side of the OpenShift Console, under the "Monitoring" section, click the link  for "Metrics".

1. Click "Log in with OpenShift" button.
1. On the "Authorize Access" page, click the "Allow selected permissions" button.
1. This is the Prometheus Console where PromQL queries can be executed.

##### Running Prometheus Queries
Let's run a query to see the resources memory limit all pod definitions have defined.

1. Copy and paste the following query into the query text box:
+
[source,role="copypaste"]
----
sum(kube_pod_container_resource_limits_memory_bytes)/(1024^3)
----
+
1. Click the "Execute" button
1. You should now see a timeseries with a value in the list. This value is
  the latest gathered value for the timeseries as defined by this query.

Now let's run a query to see the cpu usage for the entire cluster. 

1. Copy and paste the following query into the query text box:
+
[source,role="copypaste"]
----
cluster:cpu_usage_cores:sum
----
+
1. Click the "Execute" button
1. You should now see a timeseries with a value in the list. This value is
  the latest gathered value for the timeseries as defined by this query.
1. Click the "Graph" tab to see a graph of these values over time.


##### Dashboards UI (Grafana)
In addition to the Metrics UI, OpenShift monitoring provides a preconfigured
"Dashboards" UI (aka "Grafana"). The purpose of these Dashboards is to show
multiple metrics in easy to consume form.

1. Go back to the OpenShift Console.
1. Click the "Dashboards" link under the "Monitoring" section on the left hand side.
+
[WARNING]
====
You will receive a self-signed certificate error in your browser when you
first visit the Dashboards UI console. When OpenShift is installed, by default, a CA
and SSL certificates are generated for all inter-component communication
within OpenShift, including the Grafana dashboard.
====
+
1. Click "Log in with OpenShift" button.
1. On the "Authorize Access" page, click the "Allow selected permissions" button.
1. This is the Graphana "Home Dashboard" page.
1. Click on the "Home" dropdown at the top of the page
1. Select the "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster" dashboard.
  The "Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster" dashbard shows an overview
  of the resources currently committed and actively being used by the
  cluster.
