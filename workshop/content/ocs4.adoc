= Deploying and Managing OpenShift Container Storage
// Activate experimental attribute for Keyboard Shortcut keys
:experimental:
:source-highlighter: pygments

== Lab Overview

This module is for both system administrators and application developers
interested in learning how to deploy and manage OpenShift Container Storage
(OCS). In this module you will be using OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
4.x and the OCS operator to deploy Ceph and the Multi-Cloud-Gateway (MCG) as
a persistent storage solution for OCP workloads.

=== In this lab you will learn how to

* Configure and deploy containerized Ceph and MCG
* Validate deployment of containerized Ceph and MCG
* Deploy the Rook toolbox to run Ceph and RADOS commands
* Create an application using Read-Write-Once (RWO) PVC that is based on Ceph RBD
* Create an application using Read-Write-Many (RWX) PVC that is based on CephFS
* Use OCS for Prometheus and AlertManager storage
* Use the MCG to create a bucket and use in an application
* Add more storage to the Ceph cluster
* Review OCS metrics and alerts
* Use must-gather to collect support information

== Deploy your storage backend using the OCS operator

=== Scale OCP cluster and add new worker nodes

In this section, you will first validate the OCP environment has 2 or 3 worker
nodes before increasing the cluster size by additional 3 worker nodes for OCS
resources. The `NAME` of your OCP nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker -l '!node-role.kubernetes.io/infra','!node-role.kubernetes.io/master'
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ip-10-0-153-37.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   4d4h   v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-170-25.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   4d4h   v1.19.0+9f84db3
----

Now you are going to add 3 more OCP compute nodes to cluster using *machinesets*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | grep -v infra
----

This will show you the existing *machinesets* used to create the 2 or 3 worker
nodes in the cluster already. There is a *machineset* for each of 3 AWS
Availability Zones (AZ). Your *machinesets* `NAME` will be different than
below. In the case of only 2 workers one of the *machinesets* will not have any
machines (i.e., DESIRED=0) created.

.Example output:
----
NAME                                        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-worker-us-east-2a   1         1         1       1           4d4h
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-worker-us-east-2b   1         1         1       1           4d4h
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-worker-us-east-2c   0         0                             4d4h
----

Similar to the infrastructure nodes lab, create new *MachineSets* that will in
turn create storage-specific nodes for your OCP cluster in the AWS AZs:

[source,role="execute"]
----
bash {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/machineset-generator.sh 3 workerocs 0 | oc create -f -
oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=workerocs -o name | xargs oc patch -n openshift-machine-api --type='json' -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/metadata/labels", "value":{"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker":"", "role":"storage-node", "cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage":""} }]'
oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=workerocs -o name | xargs oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=1
----

Check that you have new *machines* created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'
----

They will be in `Provisioning` for sometime and eventually in a `Running`
PHASE. The `NAME` of your machines will be different than shown below.

.Example output:
----
NAME                                                 PHASE     TYPE          REGION      ZONE
         AGE
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2a-g6cfz   Running   m5.4xlarge    us-east-2   us-east-2a   3m48s
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2b-2zdgx   Running   m5.4xlarge    us-east-2   us-east-2b   3m48s
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2c-gg7br   Running   m5.4xlarge    us-east-2   us-east-2c   3m48s
----

You can see that the workerocs *machines* are also using the AWS EC2 instance
type `m5.4xlarge`. The `m5.4xlarge` instance type has 16 cpus and 64 GB memory.

Now you want to see if our new *machines* are added to the OCP cluster.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch "oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'"
----

This step could take more than 5 minutes. The result of this command needs to
look like below before you proceed. All new workerocs *machinesets* should
have an integer, in this case `1`, filled out for all rows and under columns
`READY` and `AVAILABLE`. The `NAME` of your *machinesets* will be different
than shown below.

.Example output:
----
NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2a   1         1         1       1           16m
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2b   1         1         1       1           16m
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2c   1         1         1       1           16m
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Now check to see that you have 3 new OCP worker nodes. The `NAME` of your OCP
nodes will be different than shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker -l '!node-role.kubernetes.io/infra','!node-role.kubernetes.io/master'
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ip-10-0-147-230.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   14m    v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-153-37.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   4d4h   v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-170-25.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   4d4h   v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-175-8.us-east-2.compute.internal     Ready    worker   14m    v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-209-53.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   14m    v1.19.0+9f84db3
----

Let's check to make sure the new OCP nodes have the OCS label. This label was
added in the `workerocs` *machinesets* so every *machine* created using these
*machinesets* will have this label.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-147-230.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   15m   v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-175-8.us-east-2.compute.internal     Ready    worker   15m   v1.19.0+9f84db3
ip-10-0-209-53.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker   15m   v1.19.0+9f84db3

=== Installing the OCS operator

In this section you will be using three of the worker OCP 4 nodes to deploy
OCS 4 using the OCS Operator in OperatorHub. The following will be installed:

- An OCS *OperatorGroup*
- An OCS *Subscription*
- All other OCS resources (Operators, Ceph Pods, NooBaa Pods, StorageClasses)

Start with creating the `openshift-storage` namespace.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc create namespace openshift-storage
----

You must add the monitoring label to this namespace. This is required to get
prometheus metrics and alerts for the OCP storage dashboards. To label the
`openshift-storage` namespace use the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc label namespace openshift-storage "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true"
----

NOTE: The creation of the `openshift-storage` namespace, and the monitoring
label added to this namespace, can also be done during the OCS operator
installation using the *Openshift Web Console*.

Now switch over to your *Openshift Web Console*:

{{ MASTER_URL }}

Remember that the login is `kubeadmin` and the password is:

[source,role="copypaste"]
----
{{ KUBEADMIN_PASSWORD }}
----

Once you are logged in, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* menu.

.OCP OperatorHub
image::images/ocs/OCS-OCP-OperatorHub.png[OCP OperatorHub]

Now type `openshift container storage` in the *Filter by _keyword..._* box.

.OCP OperatorHub filter on OpenShift Container Storage Operator
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP-OperatorHub-Filter.png[OCP OperatorHub Filter]

Select `OpenShift Container Storage Operator` and then select *Install*.

.OCP OperatorHub Install OpenShift Container Storage
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-OperatorHub-Install.png[OCP OperatorHub Install]

On the next screen make sure the settings are as shown in this figure.

.OCP Subscribe to OpenShift Container Storage
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-OperatorHub-Subscribe.png[OCP OperatorHub Subscribe]

Click `Install`.

Now you can go back to your terminal window to check the progress of the
installation.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc -n openshift-storage get csv
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                  DISPLAY                       VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
ocs-operator.v4.6.0   OpenShift Container Storage   4.6.0                Succeeded
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

The resource `csv` is a shortened word for
`clusterserviceversions.operators.coreos.com`.

.Please wait until the operator `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded`
CAUTION: This will mark that the installation of your operator was
successful. Reaching this state can take several minutes.

You will now also see new operator pods in `openshift-storage`
namespace:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get pods
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
noobaa-operator-698746cd47-sp6w9       1/1     Running   0          108s
ocs-metrics-exporter-78bc44687-pg4hk   1/1     Running   0          107s
ocs-operator-6d99bc6787-d7m9d          1/1     Running   0          108s
rook-ceph-operator-59f7fb95d6-sdjd8    1/1     Running   0          108s
----

Now switch back to your *Openshift Web Console* for the remainder of the
installation for OCS 4.

Select `View Operator` in figure below to get to the OCS configuration screen.

.View Operator in openshift-storage namespace
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-View-Operator.png[View Operator in openshift-storage namespacee]

.OCS configuration screen
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-config-screen-all.png[OCS configuration screen]

On the top of the OCS configuration screen, scroll over to the right and click
on `Storage Cluster` and then click on `Create Storage Cluster` to the far
right. If you do not see `Create Storage Cluster` refresh your browser window.

.Create Storage Cluster
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-config-screen-storage-cluster.png[Create Storage Cluster]

The `Create Storage Cluster` screen will display.

.Create Storage Cluster default settings
image::images/ocs/OCS4-config-screen-partial1.png[Create Storage Cluster default settings]

Leave the default selection of `Internal`, `gp2`, `2 TiB` and Encryption `Disabled`.

.Create a new storage cluster
image::images/ocs/OCS4-config-screen-partial2.png[Create a new storage cluster]

There should be 3 worker nodes already selected that had the OCS label
applied in the last section. Execute command below and make sure they are all
selected.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes --show-labels | grep ocs | cut -d ' ' -f1
----

Then click on the button `Create` below the dialog box with the 3 workers
selected with a `checkmark`.

You can watch the deployment using the *Openshift Web Console* by going
back to the `Openshift Container Storage Operator` screen and selecting `All
instances`.

Please wait until all *Pods* are marked as `Running` in the CLI or until you
see all instances shown below as `Ready` Status in the Web Console as shown in the following diagram:

The great thing about operators and OpenShift is that the operator has the
intelligence about the deployed components built-in. And, because of the
relationship between the `CustomResource` and the operator, you can check the
status by looking at the `CustomResource` itself. When you went therough the UI
dialogs, ultimately in the back-end an instance of a `StorageCluster` was
created:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get storagecluster -n openshift-storage
----

You can check the status of the storage cluster with the following:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get storagecluster -n openshift-storage ocs-storagecluster -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}{"\n"}'
----

If it says `Ready`, you can continue.

### Getting to know the Storage Dashboards

You can now also check the status of your storage cluster with the OCS specific
*Dashboards* that are included in your *Openshift Web Console*. You can reach
this by clicking on `Overview` on your left navigation bar, then selecting
`Persistent Storage` on the top navigation bar of the content page.


.Location of OCS Dashboards
image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-Overview-Location.png[Location of OCS Dashboards]

NOTE: If you just finished your OCS 4 deployment it could take 5-10 minutes
for your *Dashboards* to fully populate. Different versions of OCP 4 may have minor differences in *Dashboard* sections and naming of *Dashboards*.

// On the left side of this *Dashboard* you see a blue link labelled `noobaa`, which will get you to the NooBaa Management Console. We will discuss this Management Console later in more detail.

Once this is all healthy, you will be able to use the three new
*StorageClasses* created during the OCS 4 Install:

- ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
- ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
- openshift-storage.noobaa.io

You can see these three *StorageClasses* from the Openshift Web Console by
expanding the `Storage` menu in the left navigation bar and selecting
`Storage Classes`. You can also run the command below:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-storage get sc
----

Please make sure the three storage classes are available in your cluster
before proceeding.

NOTE: The NooBaa pod used the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` storage class for
creating a PVC for mounting to the `db` container.

=== Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage

Since the Rook-Ceph *toolbox* is not shipped with OCS, we need to deploy it
manually.

You can patch the `OCSInitialization ocsinit` using the following command line:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch OCSInitialization ocsinit -n openshift-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableCephTools", "value": true }]'
----

After the `rook-ceph-tools` *Pod* is `Running` you can access the *toolbox*
like this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Once inside the *toolbox*, try out the following Ceph commands:

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd status
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph osd tree
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
rados df
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph versions
----

.Example output:
----

== Create a new OCP application deployment using Ceph RBD volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *StorageClass* will be used
by an OCP application + database *Deployment* to create RWO (ReadWriteOnce)
persistent storage. The persistent storage will be a Ceph RBD (RADOS Block
Device) volume in the Ceph pool `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool`.

To do so we have created a template file, based on the OpenShift
rails-pgsql-persistent template, that includes an extra parameter STORAGE_CLASS
that enables the end user to specify the *StorageClass* the PVC should use.
Feel free to download
`https://github.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-training/blob/master/training/modules/ocs4/attachments/configurable-rails-app.yaml` to check on the format of this
template. Search for `STORAGE_CLASS` in the downloaded content.

Make sure that you completed all previous sections so that you are ready to
start the Rails + PostgreSQL *Deployment*.

Start by creating a new project:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-database-app
----

Then use the `rails-pgsql-persistent` template to create the new application.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app -f {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_rails-app.yaml -p STORAGE_CLASS=ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
----

After the deployment is started you can monitor with these commands.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc status
----

Check the PVC is created.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
----

This step could take 5 or more minutes. Wait until there are 2 *Pods* in
`Running` STATUS and 4 *Pods* in `Completed` STATUS as shown below.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
postgresql-1-deploy                 0/1     Completed   0          5m48s
postgresql-1-lf7qt                  1/1     Running     0          5m40s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-build      0/1     Completed   0          5m49s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-deploy     0/1     Completed   0          3m36s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-hook-pre   0/1     Completed   0          3m28s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-pjh6q      1/1     Running     0          3m14s
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Once the deployment is complete you can now test the application and the
persistent storage on Ceph.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app -o jsonpath --template="http://{.spec.host}/articles{'\n'}"
----

This will return a route similar to this one:

.Example output:
----
http://rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-ocs4-8613.ocs4-8613.sandbox944.opentlc.com/articles
----

Copy your route (different than above) to a browser window to create articles.

Enter the `username` and `password` below to create articles and comments.
The articles and comments are saved in a PostgreSQL database which stores its
table spaces on the Ceph RBD volume provisioned using the
`ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *StorageClass* during the application
deployment.

----
username: openshift
password: secret
----

Lets now take another look at the Ceph `ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool`
created by the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *StorageClass*. Log into the
*toolbox* pod again.

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

Run the same Ceph commands as before the application deployment and compare
to results in prior section. Notice the number of objects in
`ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool` has increased. The third command lists
RBD volumes and we should now have two RBDs.

[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph df
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
rados df
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
rbd -p ocs-storagecluster-cephblockpool ls | grep vol
----

You can exit the toolbox by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing exit.

[source,role="execute"]
----
exit
----

=== Matching PVs to RBDs

A handy way to match OCP persistent volumes (*PVs*)to Ceph RBDs is to execute:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pv -o 'custom-columns=NAME:.spec.claimRef.name,PVNAME:.metadata.name,STORAGECLASS:.spec.storageClassName,VOLUMEHANDLE:.spec.csi.volumeHandle'
----
.Example output:
----

----

The second half of the `VOLUMEHANDLE` column mostly matches what your RBD is
named inside of Ceph. All you have to do is append `csi-vol-` to the front
like this:

.Get the full RBD name and the associated information for your postgreSQL *PV*

=== Expand RBD based PVCs

OpenShift 4.5 and later versions let you expand an existing PVC based on the
`ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` *StorageClass*. This section walks you through
the steps to perform a PVC expansion.

We will first artificially fill up the PVC used by the application you have
just created.

[source,role="execute"]

As observed in the output above the device named `/dev/rbd1`
is mounted as `/var/lib/pgsql/data`. This is the directory we will artificially
fill up.

As observed in the output above, the filesystem usage for `/var/lib/pgsql/data`
has increased up to 79%. By default OCP will generate a PVC alert when a PVC
crosses the 75% full threshold.

Now exit the pod.

[source,role="execute"]
----
exit
----

Let's verify an alert has appeared in the OCP event log.

==== Expand applying a modified PVC YAML file

To expand a *PVC* we simply need to change the actual amount of storage that is
requested. This can easily be performed by exporting the *PVC* specifications
into a YAML file with the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc postgresql -n my-database-app -o yaml > pvc.yaml
----

In the file `pvc.yaml` that was created, search for the following section using
your favorite editor.

.Example output:
[source,yaml]
----
[truncated]
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  volumeName: pvc-4d6838df-b4cd-4bb1-9969-1af93c1dc5e6
status: {}
----

Edit `storage: 5Gi` and replace it with `storage: 10Gi`. The resulting section
in your file should look like the output below.

.Example output:
[source,yaml]
----
[truncated]
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:

  volumeMode: Filesystem
  volumeName: pvc-4d6838df-b4cd-4bb1-9969-1af93c1dc5e6
status: {}
----

Now you can apply your updated PVC specifications using the following command:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f pvc.yaml -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
Warning: oc apply should be used on resource created by either oc create

----

You can visualize the progress of the expansion of the PVC using the following
command:

----

NOTE: The expansion process commonly takes over 30 seconds to complete and is
based on the workload of your pod. This is due to the fact that the expansion
requires the resizing of the underlying RBD image (pretty fast) while also
requiring the resize of the filesystem that sits on top of the block device. To
perform the latter the filesystem must be quiesced to be safely expanded.

CAUTION: Reducing the size of a *PVC* is NOT supported.

Another way to check on the expansion of the *PVC* is to simply display the
*PVC* information using the following command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app
----
.Example output:
----
NAME         STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                  AGE
postgresql   Bound    pvc-4d6838df-b4cd-4bb1-9969-1af93c1dc5e6   10Gi       RWO            ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   121m
----

NOTE: The `CAPACITY` column will reflect the new requested size when the
expansion process is complete.

Another method to check on the expansion of the *PVC* is to go through two
specific fields of the PVC object via the CLI.

The current allocated size for the *PVC* can be checked this way:

[source,role="execute"]
----
echo $(oc get pvc postgresql -n my-database-app -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity.storage}')
----
.Example output:
----
10Gi
----

The requested size for the *PVC* can be checked this way:

[source,role="execute"]
----
echo $(oc get pvc postgresql -n my-database-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.resources.requests.storage}')
----
.Example output:
----
10Gi
----

NOTE: When both results report the same value, the expansion was successful.

==== Expand via the User Interface

The last method available to expand a *PVC* is to do so through the *OpenShift
Web Console*. Proceed as follow:

First step is to select the project to which the *PVC* belongs to.

.Select the appropriate project
image::images/ocs/OCS-PVCResize-select-project.png[Select project]

Choose `Expand PVC` from the contextual menu.

.Choose Expand from menu
image::images/ocs/OCS-PVCResize-choose-expand-menu.png[Choose expand from the contextual menu]

In the dialog box that appears enter the new capacity for the *PVC*.

CAUTION: You can NOT reduce the size of a *PVC*.

.Enter the new size for the *PVC*
image::images/ocs/OCS-PVCResize-enter-new-size.png[Enter new size]

You now simply have to wait for the expansion to complete and for the new size
to be reflected in the console (15 GiB).

== Create a new OCP application deployment using CephFS volume

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` *StorageClass* will be used to
create a RWX (ReadWriteMany) *PVC* that can be used by multiple pods at the
same time. The application we will use is called `File Uploader`.

Create a new project:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project my-shared-storage
----

Next deploy the example PHP application called `file-uploader`:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc new-app openshift/php:7.2-ubi8~https://github.com/christianh814/openshift-php-upload-demo --name=file-uploader
----

.Example Output:
----

ubi8"

    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.2
    -----------------------
    PHP 7.2 available as container is a base platform for building and running various PHP 7.2 applications and f
rameworks. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynam
ically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commerci
al database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common
use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

Push successful
----

The command prompt returns out of the tail mode once you see _Push successful_.

NOTE: This use of the `new-app` command directly asked for application code to
be built and did not involve a template. That is why it only created a *single
Pod* deployment with a *Service* and no *Route*.

Let's make our application production ready by exposing it via a `Route` and
scale to 3 instances for high availability:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc expose svc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc scale --replicas=3 deploy/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage
----
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n my-shared-storage
----

You should have 3 `file-uploader` *Pods* in a few minutes. Repeat the command above
until there are 3 `file-uploader` *Pods* in `Running` STATUS.

[CAUTION]
====
Never attempt to store persistent data in a *Pod* that has no persistent
volume associated with it. *Pods* and their containers are ephemeral by
definition, and any stored data will be lost as soon as the *Pod* terminates
for whatever reason.
====

We can fix this by providing shared persistent storage to this application.

You can create a *PersistentVolumeClaim* and attach it into an application with
the `oc set volume` command. Execute the following

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc set volume deploy/file-uploader --add --name=my-shared-storage \
-t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=1Gi \
--claim-name=my-shared-storage --claim-class=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs \
--mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded \
-n my-shared-storage
----

This command will:

* create a *PersistentVolumeClaim*
* update the *Deployment* to include a `volume` definition
* update the *Deployment* to attach a `volumemount` into the specified
  `mount-path`
* cause a new deployment of the 3 application *Pods*

For more information on what `oc set volume` is capable of, look at its help
output with `oc set volume -h`. Now, let's look at the result of adding the
volume:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-shared-storage
----

.Sample Output:
----
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                AGE
my-shared-storage   Bound    pvc-c34bb9db-43a7-4eca-bc94-0251d7128721   1Gi        RWX            ocs-storagecluster-cephfs   47s
----

Notice the `ACCESSMODE` being set to *RWX* (short for `ReadWriteMany`).

All 3 `file-uploader`*Pods* are using the same *RWX* volume. Without this
`ACCESSMODE`, OpenShift will not attempt to attach multiple *Pods* to the
same *PersistentVolume* reliably. If you attempt to scale up deployments that
are using *RWO* or `ReadWriteOnce` storage, the *Pods* will actually all
become co-located on the same node.

Now let's use the file uploader web application using your browser to upload
new files.

First, find the *Route* that has been created:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route file-uploader -n my-shared-storage -o jsonpath --template="http://{.spec.host}{'\n'}"
----

This will return a route similar to this one:

.Example Output:
----
http://file-uploader-my-shared-storage.apps.cluster-ocs4-abdf.ocs4-abdf.sandbox744.opentlc.com
----

Point your browser to the web application using your route above. *Your `route`
will be different.*

The web app simply lists all uploaded files and offers the ability to upload
new ones as well as download the existing data. Right now there is
nothing.

Select an arbitrary file from your local machine and upload it to the app.

image::images/ocs/uploader_screen_upload.png[]

Once done click *_List uploaded files_* to see the list of all currently
uploaded files.

=== Expand CephFS based PVCs

OpenShift 4.5 and later versions let you expand an existing *PVC* based on the
`ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` *StorageClass*. This chapter walks you through the
steps to perform a PVC expansion through the CLI.

NOTE: All the other methods described for expanding a Ceph RBD based *PVC* are
also available.

The `my-sharged-storage` *PVC* size is currently `1Gi`. Let's increase the size to `5Gi` using the *oc patch* command.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch pvc my-shared-storage -n my-shared-storage --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/resources/requests/storage", "value": "5Gi" }]'
----
.Example output:
----
persistentvolumeclaim/my-shared-storage patched
----

Now let's verify the RWX *PVC* has been expanded.

[source,role="execute"]
----
echo $(oc get pvc my-shared-storage -n my-shared-storage -o jsonpath='{.spec.resources.requests.storage}')
----
.Example output:
----
5Gi
----

[source,role="execute"]
----
echo $(oc get pvc my-shared-storage -n my-shared-storage -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity.storage}')
----
.Example output:
----
5Gi
----

Repeat both commands until output values are identical.

NOTE: CephFS based RWX *PVC* resizing, as opposed to RBD based *PVCs*, is
almost instantaneous. This is due to the fact that resizing such PVC does not
involved resizing a filesystem but simply involves updating a quota for the
mounted filesystem.

CAUTION: Reducing the size of a CephFS *PVC* is NOT supported.

== PVC Clone and Snapshot

Starting with version OCS version 4.6, the `Container Storage Interface` (CSI) features of being able to clone or snapshot a persistent volume are now supported. These new capabilities are very important for protecting persistent data and can be used with third party `Backup and Restore` vendors that have CSI integration. 

In addition to third party backup and restore vendors, OCS snapshot for Ceph RBD and CephFS PVCs can be triggered using `OpenShift APIs for Data Protection` (OADP) which is an un-supported community operator in *OperatorHub* that can be very useful for testing backup and restore of persistent data including OpenShift metadata (definition files for pods, service, routes, deployments, etc.).

=== PVC Clone 

A CSI volume clone is a duplicate of an existing persistent volume at a particular point in time. Cloning creates an exact duplicate of the specified volume in OCS. After dynamic provisioning, you can use a volume clone just as you would use any standard volume.

==== Provisioning a CSI Volume clone

For this exercise we will use the already created *PVC* `postgresql` that was just expanded to 15 GiB. Make sure you have done section <<Create a new OCP application deployment using Ceph RBD volume>> before proceeding.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app | awk {'print $1}'
----
.Example output:
----
NAME
postgresql
----

CAUTION: Make sure you expanded the `postgresql` *PVC* to 15Gi before proceeding. If not expanded go back and complete this section <<Expand RBD based PVCs>>.

Before creating the PVC clone make sure to create and save at least one new article so there is new data in the `postgresql` *PVC*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app -o jsonpath --template="http://{.spec.host}/articles{'\n'}"  
----

This will return a route similar to this one.

.Example output:
----
http://rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.apps.cluster-ocs4-8613.ocs4-8613.sandbox944.opentlc.com/articles
----

Copy your route (different than above) to a browser window to create articles.

Enter the `username` and `password` below to create a new article.

----
username: openshift
password: secret
----

To protect the data (articles) in this *PVC* we will now clone this PVC. The operation of creating a clone can be done using the *OpenShift Web Console* or by creating the resource via a YAML file.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgresql-clone
  namespace: my-database-app
spec:
  storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 15Gi
  dataSource:
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    name: postgresql
----

Doing the same operation in the *OpenShift Web Console* would require navigating to `Storage` -> `Persistent Volume Claim` and choosing `Clone PVC`.

.Persistent Volume Claim clone PVC using UI
image::images/ocs/OCP4-OCS4-Clone-PVC.png[Persistent Volume Claim clone PVC using UI]

Size of new clone *PVC* is greyed out. The new *PVC* will be the same size as the original.

.Persistent Volume Claim clone configuration
image::images/ocs/OCP4-OCS4-Clone-PVC-config.png[Persistent Volume Claim clone configuration]
    
Now create a *PVC* clone for `postgresql`.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/postgresql-clone.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
persistentvolumeclaim/postgresql-clone created
----

Now check to see there is a new *PVC*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-database-app | grep clone
----
.Example output:
----
postgresql-clone   Bound    pvc-f5e09c63-e8aa-48a0-99df-741280d35e42   15Gi       RWO            ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   3m47s
----

You can also check the new clone *PVC* in the *OpenShift Web Console*.

==== Using a CSI Volume clone for application recovery

Now that you have a clone for `postgresql` *PVC* you are ready to test by corrupting the database. 

The following command will print all `postgresql` tables before deleting the article tables in the database and after the tables are deleted.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc rsh -n my-database-app $(oc get pods -n my-database-app|grep postgresql | grep -v deploy | awk {'print $1}') psql -c "\c root" -c "\d+" -c "drop table articles cascade;" -c "\d+"
----
.Example output:
----
You are now connected to database "root" as user "postgres".

----

Now go back to the browser tab where you created your article using this link:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app -o jsonpath --template="http://{.spec.host}/articles{'\n'}"  
----

If you refresh the browser you will see the application has failed.

.Application failed because database table removed
image::images/ocs/rails-postgresql-failed.png[Application failed because database table removed]

Remember a *PVC* clone is an exact duplica of the original *PVC* at the time the clone was created. Therefore you can use you `postgresql` clone to recover the application.

First you need to scale the `rails-pgsql-persistent` deployment down to zero so the *Pod* will be deleted.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc scale deploymentconfig rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app --replicas=0
----
.Example output:
----
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rails-pgsql-persistent scaled
----

Verify the *Pod* is gone.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n my-database-app | grep rails | egrep -v 'deploy|build|hook' | awk {'print $1}'
----

Wait until there is no result for this command. Repeat if necessary. 

Now you need to patch the deployment for `postgesql` and modify to use the `postgresql-clone` *PVC*. This can be done using the `oc patch` command.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc patch dc postgresql -n my-database-app --type json --patch  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/volumes/0/persistentVolumeClaim/claimName", "value": "postgresql-clone" }]'
----
.Example output:
----
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/postgresql patched
----

After modifying the deployment with the clone *PVC* the `rails-pgsql-persistent` deployment needs to be scaled back up.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc scale deploymentconfig rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app --replicas=1
----
.Example output:
----
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/rails-pgsql-persistent scaled
----

Now check to see that there is a new `postgresql` and `rails-pgsql-persistent` *Pod*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n my-database-app | egrep 'rails|postgresql' | egrep -v 'deploy|build|hook'
----
.Example output:
----
postgresql-4-hv5kb                  1/1     Running     0          5m58s
rails-pgsql-persistent-1-dhwhz      1/1     Running     0          5m10s
----

Go back to the browser tab where you created your article using this link:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get route rails-pgsql-persistent -n my-database-app -o jsonpath --template="http://{.spec.host}/articles{'\n'}"  
----

If you refresh the browser you will see the application is back online and you have your articles. You can even add more articles now.

This process shows the pratical reasons to create a *PVC* clone if you are testing an application where data corruption is a possibility and you want a known good copy or `clone`. 

Let's next look at a similar feature, creating a *PVC* snapshot.

=== PVC Snapshot

Creating the first snapshot of a PVC is the same as creating a clone from that PVC. However, after an initial PVC snapshot is created, subsequent snapshots only save the delta between the initial snapshot the current contents of the PVC. Snapshots are frequently used by backup utilities which schedule incremental backups on a periodic basis (e.g. hourly). Snapshots are more capacity efficient than creating full clones each time period (e.g. hourly), as only the deltas to the PVC are stored in each snapshot. 

A snapshot can be used to provision a new volume by creating a *PVC* clone. The volume clone can be used for application recovery as demonstrated in the previous section.

==== VolumeSnapshotClass

To create a volume snapshot there first must be *VolumeSnapshotClass* resources that will be referenced in the *VolumeSnapshot* definition. The deployment of OCS (must be version 4.6 or greater) creates two *VolumeSnapshotClass* resources for creating snapshots.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get volumesnapshotclasses
----
.Example output:
----
$ oc get volumesnapshotclasses
NAME                                        DRIVER                                  DELETIONPOLICY   AGE
ocs-storagecluster-cephfsplugin-snapclass   openshift-storage.cephfs.csi.ceph.com   Delete           4d23h
ocs-storagecluster-rbdplugin-snapclass      openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com      Delete           4d23h
----

You can see by the naming of the *VolumeSnapshotClass* that one is for creating CephFS volume snapshots and the other is for Ceph RBD.

==== Provisioning a CSI Volume snapshot

For this exercise we will use the already created *PVC* `my-shared-storage`. Make sure you have done section <<Create a new OCP application deployment using CephFS volume>> before proceeding.

The operation of creating a snapshot can be done using the *OpenShift Web Console* or by creating the resource via a YAML file.

==== Restoring Volume Snapshot to clone PVC

You can now restore the new *VolumeSnapshot* in the *OpenShift Web Console*. Navigate to `Storage` -> `Volume Snapshots`. Select `Restore as new PVC`. Make sure to have the `my-shared-storage` project selected at the top left.

.Persistent Volume Claim snapshot restore in UI
image::images/ocs/OCP4-OCS4-Snapshot-restore.png[Persistent Volume Claim snapshot restore in UI]

Chose the correct *StorageClass* to create the new clone from snapshot *PVC* and select `Restore`. The size of the new *PVC* is greyed out and is same as the `parent` or original *PVC* `my-shared-storage`. 

.Persistent Volume Claim snapshot restore configuration
image::images/ocs/OCP4-OCS4-Snapshot-restore-config.png[Persistent Volume Claim snapshot restore configuration]

Check to see if there is a new *PVC* restored from the *VolumeSnapshot*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pvc -n my-shared-storage | grep restore
----
.Example output:
----

----

The output shows a new *PVC* that could be used to recover an application if there is corruption or lost data.

== Using OCS for Prometheus Metrics

OpenShift ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack that
is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider eco-system. It
provides monitoring of cluster components and ships with a set of alerts to
immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems. For
production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent
storage using block storage technology. OCS 4 provide block storage using Ceph
RBD volumes. Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your
metrics are stored to a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted
or recreated. This section will detail how to migrate Prometheus and
AlertManager storage to Ceph RBD volumes for persistence.

First, let's discover what *Pods* and *PVCs* are installed in the
`openshift-monitoring` namespace. In the prior module, OpenShift Infrastructure
Nodes, the Prometheus and AlertManager resources were moved to the OCP infra
nodes.

----

At this point there are no *PVC* resources because Prometheus and AlertManager
are both using ephemeral (EmptyDir) storage. This is the way OpenShift is
initially installed. The Prometheus stack consists of the Prometheus database
and the alertmanager data. Persisting both is best-practice since data loss on
either of these will cause you to lose your metrics and alerting data.

### Modifying your Prometheus environment

For Prometheus every supported configuration change is controlled through a
central *ConfigMap*, which needs to exist before we can make changes. When you
start off with a clean installation of Openshift, the ConfigMap to configure
the Prometheus environment may not be present. To check if your ConfigMap is
present, execute this:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----
.Output if the ConfigMap is not yet created:
----
Error from server (NotFound): configmaps "cluster-monitoring-config" not found
----

.Output if the ConfigMap is created:
----
NAME                        DATA   AGE
cluster-monitoring-config   1      116m
----

If you are missing the *ConfigMap*, create it using this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_cluster-monitoring-noinfra.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
configmap/cluster-monitoring-config created
----

[Note]
====
If the *ConfigMap* already exists because of completing prior module
`OpenShift Infrastructure Nodes`, you will apply changes to the existing
*ConfigMap*.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f {{ HOME_PATH }}/support/ocslab_cluster-monitoring-withinfra.yaml
----
.Example output:
----
configmap/cluster-monitoring-config updated
----
====

You can view the *ConfigMap* with the following command:

NOTE: The size of the Ceph RBD volumes, `40Gi`, can be modified to be larger or
smaller depending on requirements.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config -o yaml | more
----

.ConfigMap sample output:
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          name: prometheusdb
        spec:
          storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
[...]
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        metadata:
          name: alertmanager
        spec:
          storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
[...]
----

Once you create this new *ConfigMap* `cluster-monitoring-config`, the
affected *Pods* will automatically be restarted and the new storage will be
mounted in the Pods.

NOTE: It is not possible to retain data that was written on the default
EmptyDir-based or ephemeral installation. Thus you will start with an empty
DB after changing the backend storage thereby starting over with metric
collection and reporting.

After a couple of minutes, the AlertManager and Prometheus *Pods* will have
restarted and you will see new *PVCs* in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace
that they are now providing persistent storage.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods,pvc -n openshift-monitoring

----

You can validate that Prometheus and AlertManager are working correctly after
moving to persistent storage <<Monitoring the OCS environment>> in a later
section of this lab guide.

== Using the Multi-Cloud-Gateway

In this section, you will deploy a new OCP application that uses `Object Bucket
Claims` (OBCs) to create dynamic buckets via the `Multicloud Object Gateway`
(MCG). You will also use the `MCG Console` to validate new objects in the
`Object Bucket`.

NOTE: The `MCG Console` is not fully integrated with the *Openshift Web Console*
and resources created in the `MCG Console` are not synchronized back to the
Openshift Cluster. For MCG features such as Namespace buckets, please use the
MCG console to configure.

=== Checking on the MCG status

The MCG status can be checked with the NooBaa CLI. Make sure you are in the
`openshift-storage` project when you execute this command.

The NooBaa status command will first check on the environment and will then
print all the information about the environment. Besides the status of the MCG,
the second most intersting information for us are the available S3 addresses
that we can use to connect to our MCG buckets. We can chose between using the
external DNS which incurs DNS traffic cost, or route internally inside of our
Openshift cluster.

You can get a more basic overview of the MCG status using the `Object Service`
*Dashboard*. To reach this, log into the *Openshift Web Console*, click on
`Home` and select the `Overview` item. In the main view, select `Object
Service` in the top navigation bar. This dashboard does not give you connection
information for your S3 endpoint, but offers Graphs and runtime information
about the usage of your S3 backend as well as a link to the `MCG Console`.

=== Creating and Using Object Bucket Claims

MCG *ObjectBucketClaims* (OBCs) are used to dynamically create S3 compatible
buckets that can be used by an OCP application. When an OBC is created MCG
creates a new *ObjectBucket* (OB), *ConfigMap* (CM) and *Secret* that together
contain all the information your application needs to connect to the new bucket
from within your deployment.

To demonstrate this feature we will use the Photo-Album demo application. 

Run the application startup script which will build and deploy the application to your cluster. 

[source,role="execute"]
----

NOTE: *OBs*, similar to *PVs*, are cluster-scoped resources so therefore adding the namespace is not needed.

You can also view the new bucket *ConfigMap* and *Secret* using the following commands.

The *ConfigMap* will contain important information such as the bucket name, service and port. All are used to configure the connection from within the deployment to the s3 endpoint.

To view the *ConfigMap* created by the OBC, run the following:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n demo get cm photo-album -o yaml | more

  BUCKET_PORT: "443"
  BUCKET_REGION: ""
  BUCKET_SUBREGION: ""
kind: ConfigMap
[...]
----

The *Secret* will contain the credentials required for the application to connect and access the new object bucket. The credentials or keys are `base64` encoded in the *Secret*.

To view the *Secret* created for the OBC run the following:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc -n demo get secret photo-album -o yaml | more

----

As you can see when the new *OBC* and *OB* are created, MCG creates an associated *Secret* and *ConfigMap* which contain all the information required for our photo-album application to use the new bucket.

To view exactly how the application uses the information in the new *Secret* and *ConfigMap* have a look at the file `photo-album/app.yaml` after you have deployed the app. 

In order to view the details of the *ObjectBucketClaim* view the start of `photo-album/app.yaml`. In the *DeploymentConfig* specification section, find `env:` and you can see how the *ConfigMap* and *Secret* details are mapped to environment variables.

== Adding storage to the Ceph Cluster

Adding storage to OCS adds capacity and performance to your already present
cluster.

NOTE: The reason for adding more OCP worker nodes for storage is because the
existing nodes do not have adequate CPU and/or Memory available.

=== Add storage worker nodes

This section will explain how one can add more worker nodes to the present
storage cluster. Afterwards follow the next sub-section on how to extend the
OCS cluster to provision storage on these new nodes.

To add more nodes, we could either add more *machinesets* like we did before,
or scale the already present OCS *machinesets*. For this training, we will
spawn more workers by scaling the already present OCS worker instances up from 1 to 2 *machines*.

.Check on our current workerocs *machinesets* and *machine* counts:
[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'
----
Example output:
----
NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2a   1         1         1       1           2d
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2b   1         1         1       1           2d
cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2c   1         1         1       1           2d
----

Let's scale the workerocs machinesets up with this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api -o name | grep workerocs | xargs -n1 -t oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2
----
.Example output:
----
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2a
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2a scaled
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2b
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2b scaled
oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2 machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2c
machineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster-ocs4-8613-bc282-workerocs-us-east-2c scaled
----

Wait until the new OCP workers are available. This could take 5 minutes or more
so be patient. You will know the new OCP worker nodes are available when you
have the number `2` in all columns.

[source,role="execute"]
----
watch "oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'"
----

You can exit by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

Once they are available, you can check to see if the new OCP worker nodes have
the OCS label applied. The total of OCP nodes with the OCS label should now be
six.

NOTE: The OCS label `cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage=` is already
applied because it is configured in the workerocs *machinesets* that you used
to create the new worker nodes.

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes -l cluster.ocs.openshift.io/openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}'
----
.Example output:
----
ip-10-0-147-230.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-157-22.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-175-8.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-183-84.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-209-53.us-east-2.compute.internal
ip-10-0-214-36.us-east-2.compute.internal
----

Now that you have the new instances created with the OCS label, the next step
is to add more storage to the Ceph cluster. The OCS operator will prefer the
new OCP nodes with the OCS label because they have no OCS *Pods* scheduled yet.

=== Add storage capacity

In this section we will add storage capacity and performance to the
configured OCS worker nodes and the Ceph cluster. If you have followed the
previous section you should now have 6 OCS nodes.

To add storage, go to the *Openshift Web Console* and follow these steps to
reach the OCS storage cluster overview:

 - Click on `Operators` on the left navigation bar
 - Select `Installed Operators` and select `openshift-storage` project
 - Click on `Openshift Container Storage Operator`
 - In the top navigation bar, scroll right to find the item `Storage Cluster` and click on it

image::images/ocs/OCS4-OCP4-Storage-Cluster-overview-reachit.png[]

 - The visible list should list only one item - click on the three dots on the far right to extend the options menu
 - Select `Add Capacity` from the options menu

.Add Capacity dialog
image::images/ocs/OCS4-add-capacity.png[Add Capacity dialog]

The storage class should be set to `gp2`. The added provisioned capacity will
be three times as much as you see in the `Raw Capacity` field, because OCS uses
a replica count of 3.

NOTE: *The size chosen for OCS Service Capacity during the initial deployment of OCS is greyed out and cannot be changed.*

Once you are done with your setting, proceed by clicking on `Add`. You will
see the Status of the Storage Cluster is `Ready`.

CAUTION: It may take more than 5 minutes for new OSD pods to be in a `Running` state.

Use this command to see the new OSD pods:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName -n openshift-storage | grep osd | grep -v prepare
----
.Example output:

.compute.internal
----

This is everything that you need to do to extend the OCS storage.

=== Verify new storage

Once you added the capacity and made sure that the OSD pods are present, you
can also optionally check the additional storage capacity using the Ceph *toolbox* created earlier. Follow these steps:

[source,role="execute"]
----
TOOLS_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-storage -l app=rook-ceph-tools -o name)
oc rsh -n openshift-storage $TOOLS_POD
----

.Check the status of the Ceph cluster:
[source,role="execute"]
----
ceph status
----
.Example output:
----
sh-4.2# ceph status
  cluster:
    id:     e3398039-f8c6-4937-ba9d-655f5c01e0ae

    osd: 6 osds: 6 up (since 38s), 6 in (since 38s) <1>

  task status:
      scrub status:

    pgs:     192 active+clean

  io:
    client:   1.2 KiB/s rd, 1.7 KiB/s wr, 2 op/s rd, 0 op/s wr
----

In the Ceph status output, we can already see that:

<1> We now use 6 osds in total and they are `up` and `in` (meaning the daemons are running and being used to store data)
<2> The available raw capacity has increased from 6 TiB to 12 TiB

Besides that, nothing has changed in the output.

.Check the topology of your cluster:

  5   ssd  2.00000                 osd.5
----

<1> We now have additional hosts, which are extending the storage in the respective zone.

Since our Ceph cluster's CRUSH rules are set up to replicate data between the
zones, this is an effective way to reduce the load on the 3 initial nodes.

Existing data on the original OSDs will be balanced out automatically, so
that the old and the new OSDs share the load.

You can exit the *toolbox* by either pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by executing exit.

== Monitoring the OCS environment

This section covers the different tools available when it comes to monitoring
OCS the environment. This section relies on using the *OpenShift Web Console*.

Individuals already familiar with OCP will feel comfortable with this section
but for those who are not, it will be a good primer.

The monitoring tools are accessible through the main *OpenShift Web Console*
left pane. Click the *Monitoring* menu item to expand and have access to the
following 3 selections:

* Alerting
* Metrics
* Dashboards

=== Alerting

Click on the *Alerting* item to open the Alert window as illustrated in the
screen capture below.

.OCP Monitoring Menu
image::images/ocs/metrics-alertingleftpanemenu.png[OCP Monitoring Menu]

This will take you to the *Alerting* homepage as illustrated below.

.OCP Alerting Homepage
image::images/ocs/metrics-alertinghomepage.png[OCP Alerting Homepage]

You can display the alerts in the main window using the filters at your
disposal.

* 1 - Will let you select alerts by State, Severity and Sourc
* 2 - Will let you select if you want to search a specific character string
  using either the `Name` or the `Label`
* 3 - Will let you enter the character string you are searching for

The alert `State` can be.

* `Firing` - Alert has been confirmed
* `Silenced` - Alerts that have been silenced while they were in `Pending` or `Firing` state
* `Pending` - Alerts that have been triggered but not confirmed

NOTE: An alert transitions from `Pending` to `Firing` state if the alert
persists for more than the amount of time configured in the alert definition
(e.g. 10 minutes for the `CephClusterWarningState` alert).

The alert `Severity` can be.

* `Critical` - Alert is tagged as critical
* `Warning` - Alert is tagged as warning
* `Info` - Alert is tagged as informational
* `None` - The alert has no `Severity` assigned

The alert `Source` can be.

* `Platform` - Alert is generated by an OCP component
* `User` - Alert is generated by a user application

As illustrated below, alerts can be filtered precisely using multiple criteria.

.OCP Alerting Status Filtering
image::images/ocs/metrics-alertingstatusfilter.png[OCP Alert Status Filtering]

NOTE: You can clear all filters to view all the existing alerts.

If you select `View Alerting Rule` you will get access to the details of the
rule that triggered the alert. The details include the Prometheus query used
by the alert to perform the detection of the condition.

.OCP Alert Contextual Menu
image::images/ocs/metrics-alertingcontextualmenu.png[OCP Alert Contextual Menu]

.OCP Alert Detail Display
image::images/ocs/metrics-alertingviewrule.png[OCP Alert Detailed Display]

NOTE: If desired, you can click the Prometheus query embedded in the alert.
Doing so will take you to the *Metrics* page where you will be able to
execute the query for the alert and if desired make changes to the rule.

=== Metrics

Click on the *Metrics* item as illustrated below in the `Monitoring` menu.

.OCP Metrics Menu
image::images/ocs/metrics-metricsleftpanemenu.png[OCP Metrics Menu]

This will take you to the *Metrics* homepage as illustrated below.

.OCP Monitoring Metrics Homepage
image::images/ocs/metrics-queryfield.png[OCP Monitoring Metrics Homepage]

Use the query field to either enter the formula of your choice or to search for
metrics by name. The metrics available will let you query both OCP related
information or OCS related information. The queries can be simple or complex
using the Prometheus query syntax and all its available functions.

Let's start testing a simple query example and enter the following text
`ceph_osd_op` in the query field. When you are done typing, simply hit
`[Enter]` or select `Run Queries`.

.Simple Ceph Query
image::images/ocs/metrics-simplecephquery.png[Ceph Simple Query]

The window should refresh with a graph similar to the one below.

.Simple Ceph Graph
image::images/ocs/metrics-simplecephgraph.png[Ceph Simple Graph]

Then let's try a more relevant query example and enter the following text
`rate(ceph_osd_op[5m])` or `irate(ceph_osd_op[5m])` in the query field. When
you are done typing, simply hit `[Enter]`or select `Run Queries`.

.Complex Ceph Query
image::images/ocs/metrics-complexcephquery.png[Ceph Complex Query]

The window should refresh with a graph similar to the one below.

.Complex Ceph Graph
image::images/ocs/metrics-complexcephgraph.png[Ceph Complex Graph]

All OCP metrics are also available through the integrated *Metrics* window.
Feel free to try with any of the OCP related metrics such as
`irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])` for example.

.Complex OCP Graph
image::images/ocs/metrics-complexocpgraph.png[OCP Complex Graph]

Have a look at the difference between `sum(irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m]))` and the last query `irate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])`.

NOTE: For more information on the Prometheus query language visit the
link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Prometheus
Query Documentation].

== Using must-gather

Must-gather is a tool for collecting data about your running Openshift cluster.
It loads a predefined set of containers that execute multiple programs and
write results on the local workstation's filesystem. The local files can then
be uploaded to a Red Hat case and used by a remote support engineer to debug a
problem without needing direct access to your cluster. This utility and method
for diagnostic collection is similar to sosreports for RHEL hosts.

The OCS team has released its own must-gather image for the must-gather tool
that runs storage specific commands.

You can run this diagnostic tool like this for generic OpenShift debugging:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather
----

Or like this for OCS specific results:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/ocs4/ocs-must-gather-rhel8:v4.6
----

The output will then be saved in the current directory inside of a new folder
called `must-gather.local.(random)`

More runtime options can be displayed with this command:

[source,role="execute"]
----
oc adm must-gather -h
----
.Example output:
----
Launch a pod to gather debugging information

 This command will launch a pod in a temporary namespace on your cluster that gathers debugging information and then
downloads the gathered information.

 Experimental: This command is under active development and may change without notice.

Usage:
  oc adm must-gather [flags]

Examples:
  # gather information using the default plug-in image and command, writing into ./must-gather.local.<rand>
  oc adm must-gather

  # gather information with a specific local folder to copy to
  oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=/local/directory

  # gather information using multiple plug-in images
  oc adm must-gather --image=quay.io/kubevirt/must-gather --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-must-gather

  # gather information using a specific image stream plug-in
  oc adm must-gather --image-stream=openshift/must-gather:latest

  # gather information using a specific image, command, and pod-dir
  oc adm must-gather --image=my/image:tag --source-dir=/pod/directory -- myspecial-command.sh

Options:
      --dest-dir='': Set a specific directory on the local machine to write gathered data to.
      --image=[]: Specify a must-gather plugin image to run. If not specified, OpenShift's default must-gather image
will be used.
      --image-stream=[]: Specify an image stream (namespace/name:tag) containing a must-gather plugin image to run.
      --node-name='': Set a specific node to use - by default a random master will be used
      --source-dir='/must-gather/': Set the specific directory on the pod copy the gathered data from.

Use "oc adm options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).

[appendix]
== Introduction to Ceph

This section will go through Ceph fundamental knowledge for a better
understanding of the underlying storage solution
used by OCS 4.


NOTE: The content in this Appendix is relevant to learning about the critical
components of Ceph and how Ceph works. OCS 4 uses Ceph in a prescribed manner
for providing storage to OpenShift applications. Using *Operators* and
*CustomResourceDefinitions* (CRDs) for deploying and managing OCS 4 may
restrict some of Ceph's advanced features when compared to general use
outside of OCP 4.

[.lead]
*Timeline*

The Ceph project has a long history as you can see in the timeline below.

.Ceph Project History
image::images/ocs/ceph101-timeline.png[Ceph Project Timeline]

[.lead]
It is a battle-tested software defined storage (SDS) solution that has been
available as a storage backend for OpenStack and Kubernetes for quite some
time.

[.lead]
*Architecture*

The Ceph cluster provides a scalable storage solution while providing
multiple access methods to enable the different types of
clients present within the IT infrastructure to get access to the data.

.Ceph Architecture
image::images/ocs/ceph101-overview.png[Ceph From Above]

[.lead]
The entire Ceph architecture is resilient and does not present any single point
of failure (SPOF).

[.lead]
*RADOS*

The heart of Ceph is an object store known as RADOS (Reliable Autonomic
Distributed Object Store) bottom layer on the screen. This layer provides the
Ceph software defined storage with the ability to store data (serve IO
requests, to protect the data, to check the consistency and the integrity of
the data through built-in mechanisms. The RADOS layer is composed of the
following daemons:

1. MONs or Monitors
2. OSDs or Object Storage Devices
3. MGRs or Managers
4. MDSs or Meta Data Servers

.*_Monitors_*
The Monitors maintain the cluster map and state and provide distributed
decision-making while configured in an odd number, 3 or 5 depending on the
size and the topology of the cluster, to prevent split-brain situations. The
Monitors are not in the data-path and do not serve IO requests to and from
the clients.

.*_OSDs_*
One OSD is typically deployed for each local block devices and the native
scalable nature of Ceph allows for thousands of OSDs to be part of the
cluster. The OSDs are serving IO requests from the clients while guaranteeing
the protection of the data (replication or erasure coding), the rebalancing
of the data in case of an OSD or a node failure, the coherence of the data
(scrubbing and deep-scrubbing of the existing data).

.*_MGRs_*
The Managers are tightly integrated with the Monitors and collect the
statistics within the cluster. Additionally they provide an extensible
framework for the cluster through a pluggable Python interface aimed at
expanding the Ceph existing capabilities. The current list of modules
developed around the Manager framework are:

* Balancer module
* Placement Group auto-scaler module
* Dashboard module
* RESTful module
* Prometheus module
* Zabbix module
* Rook module

.*_MDSs_*
The Meta Data Servers manage the metadata for the POSIX compliant shared
filesystem such as the directory hierarchy and the file metadata (ownership,
timestamps, mode, ...). All the metadata is stored with RADOS and they do not
server any data to the clients. MDSs are only deployed when a shared
filesystem is configured in the Ceph cluster.

If we look at the Ceph cluster foundation layer, the full picture with the
different types of daemons or containers looks like this.

.RADOS as it stands

The circle represent the MONs, the 'M' represent the MGRs and the squares
with the bars represent the OSDs. In the diagram above, the cluster operates
with 3 Monitors, 2 Managers and 23 OSDs.

*Access Methods*

Ceph was designed to provides the IT environment with all the necessary
access methods so that any application can use what is the best solution for
its use-case.

.Different Storage Types Supported
image::images/ocs/ceph101-differentstoragetypes.png[Ceph Access Modes]

Ceph supports block storage through the RADOS Block Device (aka RBD) access
method, file storage through the Ceph Filesystem (aka CephFS) access method
and object storage through its native `librados` API or through the RADOS
Gateway (aka RADOSGW or RGW) for compatibility with the S3 and Swift
protocols.

[.lead]
*Librados*

Librados allows developers to code natively against the native Ceph cluster
API for maximum efficiency combined with a small footprint.

.Application Native Object API
image::images/ocs/ceph101-librados.png[librados]

The Ceph native API offers different wrappers such as C, C++, Python, Java,
Ruby, Erlang, Go and Rust.

[.lead]
*RADOS Block Device (RBD)*

This access method is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift version
3.x or 4.x. RBDs can be accessed either through a kernel module (RHEL, OCS4)
or through the `librbd` API (RHOSP). In the OCP world, RBDs are designed to
address the need for RWO PVCs.

[.lead]
*_Kernel Module (kRBD)_*

The kernel RBD driver offers superior performance compared to the userspace
`librbd` method. However, kRBD is currently limited and does not provide the
same level of functionality. e.g., no RBD Mirroring support.

.kRBD Diagram

[.lead]
*_Userspace RBD (librbd)_*

This access method is used in Red Hat OpenStack Environment or OpenShift
through the RBD-NBD driver when available starting in the RHEL 8.1 kernel.
This mode allows us to leverage all existing RBD features such as RBD
Mirroring.

*_Shared Filesystem (CephFS)_*

This method allows clients to jointly access a shared POSIX compliant
filesystem. The client initially contacts the Meta Data Server to obtain the
location of the object(s) for a given inode and then communicates directly
with an OSD to perform the final IO request.

.File Access (Ceph Filesystem or CephFS)
image::images/ocs/ceph101-cephfs.png[Kernel Based CephFS Client]

CephFS is typically used for RWX claims but can also be used to support RWO claims.

[.lead]
*_Object Storage, S3 and Swift (Ceph RADOS Gateway)_*

This access method offers support for the Amazon S3 and OpenStack Swift
support on top of a Ceph cluster. The Openshift Container Storage Multi Cloud
Gateway can leverage the RADOS Gateway to support Object Bucket Claims. From
the Multi Cloud Gateway perspective the RADOS Gateway will be tagged as a
compatible S3 endpoint.

*CRUSH*

The Ceph cluster being a distributed architecture some solution had to be
designed to provide an efficient way to distribute the data across the
multiple OSDs in the cluster. The technique used is called CRUSH or
Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing. With CRUSH, every object is
assigned to one and only one hash bucket known as a Placement Group (PG).

image::images/ocs/ceph101-crushfromobjecttoosd.png[From Object to OSD]

CRUSH is the central point of configuration for the topology of the cluster.
It offers a pseudo-random placement algorithm to distribute the objects
across the PGs and uses rules to determine the mapping of the PGs to the
OSDs. In essence, the PGs are an abstraction layer between the objects
(application layer) and the OSDs (physical layer). In case of failure, the
PGs will be remapped to different physical devices (OSDs) and eventually see
their content resynchronized to match the protection rules selected by the
storage administrator.

[.lead]
*Cluster Partitioning*

The Ceph OSDs will be in charge of the protection of the data as well as the
constant checking of the integrity of the data stored in the entire cluster.
The cluster will be separated into logical partitions, known as pools. Each
pool has the following properties that can be adjusted:

* An ID (immutable)
* A name
* A number of PGs to distribute the objects across the OSDs
* A CRUSH rule to determine the mapping of the PGs for this pool
* A type of protection (Replication or Erasure Coding)
* Parameters associated with the type of protection
** Number of copies for replicated pools
** K and M chunks for Erasure Coding
* Various flags to influence the behavior of the cluster

[.lead]
*Pools and PGs*

.Pools and PGs
image::images/ocs/ceph101-thefullpicture.png[From Object to OSD]

The diagram above shows the relationship end to end between the object at the
access method level down to the OSDs at the physical layer.

NOTE: A Ceph pool has no size and is able to consume the space available on any
OSD where it's PGs are created. A Placement Group or PG belongs to only one
pool.

[.lead]
*Data Protection*

Ceph supports two types of data protection presented in the diagram below.

.Ceph Data Protection
image::images/ocs/ceph101-dataprotection.png[Replicated Pools vs Erasure Coded Pools]

Replicated pools provide better performance in almost all cases at the cost
of a lower usable to raw storage ratio (1 usable byte is stored using 3 bytes
of raw storage) while `Erasure Coding` provides a cost efficient way to store
data with less performance. Red Hat supports the following `Erasure Coding`
profiles with their corresponding usable to raw ratio:

* 4+2 (1:2 ratio)
* 8+3 (1:1.375 ratio)
* 8+4 (1:2 ratio)

Another advantage of `Erasure Coding` (EC) is its ability to offer extreme
resilience and durability as we can configure the number of parities being
used. EC can be used for the RADOS Gateway access method and for the RBD
access method (performance impact).

[.lead]
*Data Distribution*

To leverage the Ceph architecture at its best, all access methods but
librados, will access the data in the cluster through a collection of
objects. Hence a 1GB block device will be a collection of objects, each
supporting a set of device sectors. Therefore, a 1GB file is stored in a
CephFS directory will be split into multiple objects. Also a 5GB S3 object
stored through the RADOS Gateway via the Multi Cloud Gateway will be divided
in multiple objects.

.Data Distribution
image::images/ocs/ceph101-rbdlayout.png[RADOS Block Device Layout]

NOTE: By default, each access method uses an object size of 4MB. The above
diagram details how a 32MB RBD (Block Device) supporting a RWO PVC will be
scattered throughout the cluster.
