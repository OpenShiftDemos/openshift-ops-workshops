== Introduction to {labname}

In this lab, you explore Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) vulnerability management at build time.
This allows the build process to fail as soon as a serious, fixable vulnerability is identified in an image.

For this lab, you run a publicly available image prebuilt with known fixable vulnerabilities.
You also experiment with OpenShift^(R)^ resource manifests and the RHACS ability to warn and enforce violations.

You do both of these activities from the command line and also via a Tekton pipeline.

.Goals

* Trigger build-time violations for images and deployments on the command line and CI/CD pipelines
* Enforce a container image vulnerability violation at build time
* Codify an image vulnerability violation enforcement in a pipeline
* Explore warnings about deployment attributes from the command line

== Enforce Container Image Vulnerability Violation at Build Time

In this section, you configure the proper policies for enforcement, test them on the command line, and then execute them via Pipelines.

=== Configure RHACS Policy

.Procedure
. From the left navigation menu, select *Platform Configuration -> Policy Management*.
. Scroll down to `Fixable CVSS >= 7` (`rhacs_fix_image_vuln_policy`):
+
image::images/08_build_00.png[RHACS Policy - Configure]
+
TIP: You can find this policy quickly by entering `fixable` in the filter bar at the top of the page.
+
You can see that the `Fixable CVSS >= 7` policy has both the `Build` and `Deploy` lifecycles set as `Enabled: No`.
RHACS can detect the presence of this vulnerability in images at both stages.
But it is not yet enabled, and is not yet enforcing.
The next steps are to edit the policy to enable and enforce it.

. Review the other attributes, and note the `Rationale` and `Guidance` fields, which you can expect to see in the policy output later.
. Click the `Actions` drop down and enable the policy.
. You can also edit the policy and preview oputcomes before accept any changes to the policy.

=== Test Image Vulnerability Enforcement

After the enforcement is enabled, you can use `roxctl` to check any image for violations of this policy.
To run the image check, you need to know the exposed network endpoint for the Central component.

.Procedure
. Determine the OpenShift route to Central:
+
[source,sh]
----
CENTRAL=$( oc get route central -n stackrox -o json | jq -r '.spec.host' )
----
+
. Run the image check:
+
[source,sh]
----
roxctl -e $ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443 image check --image docker.io/vulnerables/cve-2017-7494 --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

----
When `roxctl` runs an image check, it requests Central to perform the check, evaluate policies, and return the result. Any policy violations are displayed, informing the user of the policy's _rationale_ and any _remediation_ steps. Policy failure is indicated by the process return code of `roxctl`. A zero value indicates success (no policy violation), while a non-zero value indicates failure (policy violations).

NOTE: Because vulnerabilities change often, your output results for the particular CVEs in this image may vary.
This output is truncated to improve readability.

=== Codify Image Vulnerability Violation Enforcement in Pipeline

When incorporated into a CI/CD build pipeline, this failure code stops the pipeline and leaves the policy violation output in the build job console.

.Procedure
. Navigate to your OpenShift web console, and on the left navigation menu select *Pipelines -> Pipelines*:
+
image::images/rhacs_pipeline_pipelines.png[RHACS - OpenShift Console Pipelines]
+
NOTE: You can find your OpenShift Console URL and credentials in your Red Hat provisioning email message.

. Click `rox-pipeline` to rerun the failed `rox-pipeline` pipeline with the container image you tested earlier from the command line.
+
. From this *Pipeline details* page, use the *Actions* menu to select *Start*:
+
image::images/rhacs_pipeline_start.png[RHACS Pipeline Start]
+
. In the window that appears, paste the container image URL (`docker.io/vulnerables/cve-2017-7494`) and click *Start*:
+
image::images/rhacs_pipeline_failed_docker.png[RHACS PipelineRun TaskRun failure]
+
This PipelineRun kicked off a TaskRun to run the `image-check` task.
It failed the same way it failed on the `stackrox` command line earlier.
Only this time, it is part of a pipeline and causes a build failure.

. Click the *Logs* tab to see the full output of the `image-check` failure.

NOTE: Because vulnerability changes often, your output results for the particular CVEs in this image may vary.
The output is truncated for increased readability.

== Warn About Deployment Attributes at Build Time

In this section, you explore RHACS's visibility and control over Kubernetes deployment attributes at build time--before an application is deployed--shortening the time to discover and correct workflow and configuration errors.

Kubernetes deployments are defined in YAML and declare the desired state of the application and all of its components.
Among the many supported attributes are privilege levels, secrets access, storage requirements, and, as illustrated in this next section, network service exposure.

=== Test Warnings About Deployment Attributes from Command Line

This simple YAML file declares an example deployment from a public image, and attempts to expose the service on that deployment on TCP port 22, typically reserved for SSH.

.Procedure
. On your student VM, create the `$HOME/deployment.yaml` file:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << EOF >$HOME/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-lb
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 22
  selector:
    app: ubuntu
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubuntu
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubuntu
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu:18.04
        ports:
        - containerPort: 22
EOF
----

. Use `roxctl` to run a check on the YAML code using the `--file` argument:
+
[source,sh]
----
roxctl -e $CENTRAL:443 deployment check --file deployment.yaml --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
+

The warning is clear, and the policy was enforced.
In the next section, you try it as part of a build pipeline.

=== Warn About Deployment Attributes at Build Time from Pipeline

RHACS does not check only images from pipelines--it can also check the deployment and service manifests.
In the pipeline provided in this lab, you can paste the base64-encoded manifests into the UI and verify them.
This is just a simple, focused example.
In a complete pipeline integration, these manifests are not delivered by hand as base64, but checked out of a source code control system such as Git by means of dedicated Tekton Pipeline tasks.

.Procedure
. Navigate to your OpenShift web console, and select *Pipelines -> Pipelines* from the left navigation menu:
+
image::images/rhacs_pipeline_pipelines.png[RHACS - OpenShift Console Pipelines]
+
NOTE: You can find your OpenShift Console URL and credentials in your Red Hat provisioning email message.

. Select `rox-deploy-pipeline` to run this pipeline with the container image you tested earlier from the command line.
+
IMPORTANT: This pipeline is named `rox-deploy-pipeline`.
Do not confuse it with the prior pipeline `rox-pipeline`, which only verifies images.

. From this *Pipeline details* page, use the *Actions* menu to select *Start*:

. In the window that appears, provide three required parameters:
.. In the *Parameters yaml* field, paste the following data, which is the base64-encoded representation of the manifests that you created earlier:

.. For *Workspaces* -> *files*, select `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
.. For *Select a PVC*, select the first PVC.
(PVCs can be reused, because the data is overwritten to the same file inside the PV each time.)
+
This PipelineRun kicked off two TaskRuns:
+
* The first, `write-yaml`, decoded the base64 and wrote it to the PV as `/deployfile/deploy.yaml`.
* The second, `deploy-check`, actually ran `stackrox` against the file.
+
NOTE: This PipelineRun only generated a warning. This is the same way you received a warning on the `stackrox` command line earlier, but this time it is part of a pipeline.

. Examine the *PipelineRun details* page and note that because there were no enforced policies, you do not see any failures or log snippets.

. Click the *Logs* tab to see the full output of the `deploy-check` failure:

If you'd like to investigate the `write-yaml` Task, it's implemented like this:
----
     script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        echo "$(params.yaml)" | base64 -d > /deployfile/deploy.yml

== Summary

In this lab, you became familiar with how to prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production by triggering build-time violations for images and deployments on the command line and CI/CD pipelines.
