=== Admin Ops Modules

The Admin Ops section of the workshop is divided into two modules: the first module focuses on Openshift, a container application platform that uses Kubernetes for managing and automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. The second module provides an introduction to OpenShift Ops, covering the basics of the OpenShift 4 cluster installation and utilizing a Kubernetes feature called ServiceAccounts to interact with the OpenShift API.
