= Welcome to the Hands on with OCP Plus Workshop for Summit 2023

=== Introduction

In this workshop, we aim to cover the fundamental aspects of Openshift Ops and delve into the operations side of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes. Participants can expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of the basics of Openshift Ops, such as Environment Overview, Installation and Verification, and LDAP - Configuring External Authentication Providers. Furthermore, we will explore the operational capabilities of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, providing attendees with a well-rounded understanding of how to optimize and secure their Kubernetes environments. Overall, this workshop promises to be a valuable learning experience for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of OCP Plus.

=== Admin Ops Modules

The Admin Ops section of the workshop is divided into two modules: the first module focuses on Openshift, a container application platform that uses Kubernetes for managing and automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. The second module provides an introduction to OpenShift Ops, covering the basics of the OpenShift 4 cluster installation and utilizing a Kubernetes feature called ServiceAccounts to interact with the OpenShift API.

=== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) is a multi-cluster management solution that helps organizations manage their Kubernetes clusters and applications across hybrid and multicloud environments. It provides a unified management console, policy-based governance, observability, and automation capabilities, helping to simplify and streamline Kubernetes management operations.

In this workshop we will showcase how to Manage Hosted Control Plane Clusters, deploy applications and manage polices. 

=== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS)

The RHACS workshop section is divided into two modules: 

1. The First module focuses on UI navigation and exploring vulnerable workloads, such as the log4shell or Apache struts vulnerabilities. 
2. The second module takes this learned knowledge and extends it to runtime enforcement. Here we will create a workload that violates the Ubuntu Package Manager Execution and watch how we can stop the download of any malicious packages using RHACS.
